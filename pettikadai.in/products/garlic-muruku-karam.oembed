It's like regular muruku but with garlic added for flavor. To make it, we mix rice flour, gram flour (besan), spices, and minced or powdered garlic. Then, we shape the dough into coils or spirals using a special tool and fry it until it's crunchy. Garlic murukku is a tasty snack enjoyed during festivals or as a treat with tea or coffee.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eINGREDIENTS\u003c\/strong\u003e \u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRice Flour, Fried Gram, Garlic, Red Chilly, Salt \u0026amp; Refined Vegetable Oil\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSERVING GUIDE\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStore in an airtight container\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSHELF LIFE\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e30 days\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Arvind Chettinad Snacks","offers":[{"title":"200 gms","offer_id":44763599765719,"sku":"","price":150.0,"currency_code":"INR","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0537\/5249\/6309\/files\/4_3.png?v=1755137924","url":"https:\/\/pettikadai.in\/products\/garlic-muruku-karam","provider":"pettikadai.in","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
